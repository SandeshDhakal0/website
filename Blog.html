     <h1 style="font-size: 100px;"> "Surrounded with Technology"</h1>

     <h3> If you are reading this through any media, technology has got you!</h3> 

     <p> There's always two sides of a coin. Weather we admit or not, the reality is always there.<br>
        In this era, it will be very much true to say that it has become pratically impossible to carryout<br>
        our daily activities without the help of technology. The term technology varies with the area of <br>
        usage. For a normal person to get from point A to point B a GPS has become very useful.<br>
        If we only talk out GPS applicances, it can be used from your smartphone, or from the infotainment<br>
        system of your automobile. One pursose but a multiple platfrom of usage.

    <h4>Technology in Health care </h4>

     <p> As health care becomes more automated, doctors are increasingly using robots to perform various tasks, <br>
        such as diagnosing illness and performing surgery. With healthcare costs rising at a staggering rate, the<br>
        industry is looking for new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Healthtech is helping make this possible.<br>
        Through the use of technology, hospitals can improve efficiency and expand access to healthcare. This is exactly<br>
         what healthcare innovators are doing.
     </p>
     <h4>Technology in Entertainment </h4>
    
     <p> As technology has changed the way consumers watch television, the entertainment industry has also changed. While cable <br>
        and satellite networks are still very popular, consumers are now turning to live streaming video services such as Netflix and Hulu.<br>
        Over the past couple of years, mobile platforms have become the main way for people to watch live video content. In total, they spent <br>
        more than $2 billion on these services in 2014, according to the latest Deloitte survey.
    </p>    
    <h4>More advancement is coming through</h4> 
    <p>Each day another company comes out with a new product that is more advanced than the last. This strategy is how they can win the consumer war <br>
       against their competitors. The application market was the reason why the mobile phone companies were able to dominate the market at the time. It allowed<br>
       people to do anything they wanted in seconds.<br>
